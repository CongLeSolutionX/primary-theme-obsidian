# Primary ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¦

A combination of Bauhaus, Scandinavian and yellowing magazine pages as palette inspirationâ€”Primary is a theme for people looking for a certain nostalgic warmness.

It is toppled with functional pop of red blue yellow colors. The perfect mix of loud and reserved.

Playful, reminiscing, productive.

Available in both âšªLight and âš«Dark modes.

## ðŸ“Œ Plugins Supported
More plugins will be supported in the coming weeks! For now, I've checked the theme for these:

âœ… Calendar

âœ… Dataview

âœ… Outliner

âœ… Sliding Panes

âœ… Recent Files

âœ… Advanced Tables

**Plugin TODO**

These are on the radar as I'm using these myself. If you have a particular plugin you want supported, please drop it in and I'll catch up on it!
I'm also looking to optimize the theme. It's really usable but I believe the file is still huge.

Check out the theme below! (If you want to read my process on this, scroll after Dark Mode)

## ðŸ§  Creating Primary

I had 3 problems I wanted to solve.

1. I needed a theme that would give me instant visual context. Much like how Cybertron is, but less cyber-y.
2. I needed a theme that would remind me that my PKM is fun and welcoming.
3. I needed a theme that would remind me that my PKM is not perfect.

I decided to make a theme for my own use. (Coincidentally, I found out about Obsidian October at last minute. I literally didn't start until 10 days ago. HAHAHA. This event really pushed me to start making it!)

BUT, going back to the theme, I wanted to solve these three problems.

Coming from my experience in watercoloring back in high school (and expressing that color science nerd-side of mine), I figured I wanted to go back to the basics. I thought, why not primary colors? In paint mixing for most works, a defined set of "primary colors" (or a limited palette) are all you need! Each text emphasis would correspond to a primary color. To me, italics felt blue, bold felt red, and links felt yellow. And so Problem #1 was solved.

Now, what else has primary colors? Well, I remembered Bauhaus and Ikea. My favorite Ikea items were the wooden toys. They also came in primary colors. Despite the primary colors as a basis of the design, I still wanted it to be warm (as in, feeling cozy) and not so "in your face"  or "poppy". While working on the theme, I stumbled upon one of my indie favorites, *I'm Fine by Hazel English*. The music video actually is just pages of retro magazines. What I noticed was how colorful but calming these pages were. I've gone through old magazines myself. The aspect I was most fascinated with was how the aging and yellowing affected the colors... The luxurious green was now minty. The blues were subdued. The reds were cozy. I decided to combine all of their visual language and concluded a summary explained in these following words: Warm. Wood is Warm. Primary Colors. Warm Primary Colors. Warm and Primary SCHOOLS. Primary is children? Children love to play. Children love games. Ikea wooden toys with primary colors that children love to play with? Anyway, Problem #2 is now solved.

All of these design choices and *coincidences* tied perfectly to this feeling of imperfectness. Like, a kid growing up. Karlaâ€”the ever so slightly weird looking font I've chosen for Primaryâ€”looks like a better version of your handwriting in 5th grade. The cherry on top was when I figured out how to create that specific button and box shadows style. It felt like the interface of a game I used to play!

Thus, 3 personal problems solved through this theme. I really enjoyed making this. I hope it'll give you joy too.

I'm planning to update it as best as I can and create more themes hopefully with a different design.

If you've read all the way down here, well, what the heck. Thank you for listening to my TED talk. Please go back to writing your notes or whatever was more important than my rambles. Hahaha!

## Credits
I owe a lot to @jdanielmourao, @kepano and @chetachiezikeuzor! Their work inspired me design-wise and studying their theme helped me a lot in creating mine.
